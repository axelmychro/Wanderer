honestly, i can barely remember what even happened from the start of last year.
such is the memory of an unc (at the ripe... first semester)

#### what i do remember, though:

- August: college started
- September: my bday that no one cares
- October: halloween. yes, that's it. okay, maybe that's when i started learning
  web development...
- December: that one fckss event i bothered to join as _panitia_

whoa. crazy how life before campus is just.. it "is what it is," and still kinda
is.
